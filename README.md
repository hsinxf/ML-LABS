In this lab, I followed the Manual to deepen my understanding of Git and Github.

For this lab, I practiced using the terminal to manage my project structure:

1.Directory Creation : Created LAB-2 folder using mkdir command.

2.File Initialization : Generated the README.me file using touch command.

3.Version Control : Used Git commands to add these changes to the staging area and performed a commit with a descriptive message.

I intergrated several tools to complete the workflow:

1.GitHub Desktop : Used this visual interfave to manage Push and Pull requests.

2.Visual Studio Code : Used it as my primary editor for writing codes and managing files.

3.Jupyter Notebooks : Created my first .ipynb file within VS Code, connectiong it to the Python base kernel to run interactive code cells.
